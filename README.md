# qmk_container [![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/jsanchez0x/qmk_container/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jsanchez0x/qmk_container/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml) [![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Hub-blue.svg?logo=docker&logoColor=white)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jsanchez0x/qmk_container)


Dockerfile to generate a container with everything needed to use QMK(*Quantum Mechanical Keyboard*). The final image stimated size is around 5GB.

## Get the image

### OPTION 1: Pulling from Docker Hub (*recommended*)
```bash
docker pull jsanchez0x/qmk_container
```

### OPTION 2: Building the image manually
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsanchez0x/qmk_container.git
docker build --rm --tag qmk_container:1.0 qmk_container
```

## Runing the container with shared folder
This option is interesting for sharing files between the host machine and the container. For example, you can have the project created on the host machine and use the container to generate firmware on the host machine too.
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/shared_folder qmk_container:1.0
```

## First steps inside the container
The image has been generated by executing this command for the first time. But you have to run it again to keep the QMK environment up to date.
```bash
qmk setup --yes
```

## More info
More information on how to use this image can be found in the official [QMK documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/).
